    <td>I used trial and error this week. It took many attempts to try and pick up what we were aiming for, and in the end we ran out of time. Oh well! We did get very close though, and the code was all right.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>Again, I just need to speed up. It didn't help that my partner consistently walked away, but it was OK.</td>
