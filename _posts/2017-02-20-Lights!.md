    <td>We tried to follow the tutorials as closely as we could to make sure that no mistakes were made. We didn't try to adapt the tutorials as this was new to us.</td>

    <td>We couldn’t get the lights to flash. We were trying our best to stick to the tutorials, but the pictures were hard to make out, and we couldn’t see where everything was supposed to go. In the end, we didn’t have time to finish our work. </td>
