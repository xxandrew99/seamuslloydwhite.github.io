In our last lesson, we continued to use the FUZE program book.

    <td>This week, we followed the programs, but we changed them to make them more fun and enjoyable to write. For example, we had to create a program which asked your name and gave a response, but we decided to change the question so that it asked you for the password. It gave a different response based on whether you put in the correct password.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>

  <tr>
    <td>The only issue we had today was that we were struggling with the computer. Our mouse was super sensitive, and we couldn't close tabs or save directly. We couldnâ€™t really work out what to do, so we just rebooted the computer and continued. We also had an issue where the computer crashed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that we will try and work faster, and get through more tutorials.</td>
