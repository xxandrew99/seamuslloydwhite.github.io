    <td>Today, we learnt through having fun. After finishing the tutorials, we gave the robot a toy wooden dagger to play with. Right at the end of the lesson I wrote a piece of code to give it independent movement, but I didn't get to use it.</td>

    <td>My partner and I couldnâ€™t agree on what to do, so it was very awkward, and we wasted a lot of time.</td>
