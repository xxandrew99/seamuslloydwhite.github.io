Today in I.T, we learnt how to add sales to our virtual shops.

We used our shops from last week to go further with our work on google sheets - we took our basic shops and added a bit of business to them.

First we totalled the number of items our customer was buying.

Then, we found the total cost of the items.

Next we multiplied this number by 0.8, to find what 20% off would be.

After that, we decided how many items the customer would need to buy in order to benefit from the sale.

For example, if I chose 10% off, and 4 items to initiate it:

=if(total items is greater than or equal to  4 ,(initial price * 0.9) else initial price)

It was great, and I enjoyed expanding my shop. I'm really enjoying learning about Sheets many functions!
