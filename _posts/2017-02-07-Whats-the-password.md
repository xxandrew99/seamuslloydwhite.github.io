In our last lesson, we continued to use the FUZE program book.

    <td>This week, we followed the programs, but we changed them to make them more fun and enjoyable to write. For example, we had to create a program which asked your name and gave a response, but we decided to change the question so that it asked you for the password. It gave a different response based on whether you put in the correct password.</td>

    <td>The only issue we had today was that we were struggling with the computer. Our mouse was super sensitive, and we couldn't close tabs or save directly. We couldn’t really work out what to do, so we just rebooted the computer and continued. We also had an issue where the computer crashed.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

    <td>I think that we will try and work faster, and get through more tutorials.</td>
